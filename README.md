# StroopEffect
A game based on the Stroop Effect and DFRobot's DF2301Q voice recognition module.

This is a game that takes advantage of our brains confusion
when reading the names of different colors when those names
are dispayed in a color different than the spelled word describes.

Using the DFRobot.com DF2301Q (SEN0539) Wake Phrase and Sound recognition
module we will train it to recognize the various spoken colors. Then we
will display the name of a color on a panel but in a different color
from the named color and randomly ask the user to say either the color
or the word spelled.

The user must speak either the color or the word before it times out.
Failure to say the correct color ends the game.

The game can optionally speed up as you continue to advance.
